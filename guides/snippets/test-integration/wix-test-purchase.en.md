The test purchase allows you to simulate the entire purchase and payment process to ensure that the Mercado Pago integration was done correctly in your store.

To make a test purchase, follow the steps below.

1. Go to your Wix store homepage and select a product to purchase.
2. Click on the desired product and then click **View Cart**.
3. Click **Checkout** and fill in the requested information to complete your purchase.
4. On the tab **Payment**, use one of our [national test cards](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/resources/localization/local-cards) to simulate the payment for the purchase.
5. Click to confirm the order.

If the test runs without errors, it means your store is ready to go into production mode and receive real sales.
