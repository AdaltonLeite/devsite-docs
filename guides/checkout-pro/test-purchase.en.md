# Make test purchase	

There are two ways to make the payment: as a **guest user**, filling in just an e-mail address, and as a **registered user**, accessing a Mercado Pago account with username and password.

In this last scenario, previously saved cards and available account balance will be enabled as payment methods.

## Guest User


1. Follow the purchase flow and, when opening the checkout, enter the **buyer user** data.
2. Select **Card** as payment method and enter the details of one of the available cards on our [test cards page](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/additional-content/test-cards).
3. Enter the desired email and complete the purchase.

## Registered User

1. Follow the purchase flow and, when opening the checkout, enter the **buyer user** data.
2. Access the Mercado Pago account using the **buyer test user**.
3. Select **Card** as payment method.
4. Select one of the cards previously saved in the account or enter data from one of our [test cards](/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/additional-content/test-cards).

When you finish testing, you will need to activate your credentials to receive real payments. To do this, make sure that the credentials used in your integration are those of the account that will receive the sales money.
