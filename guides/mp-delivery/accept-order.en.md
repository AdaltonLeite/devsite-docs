# Accept order

When the delivery status returns **Ready_to_ship** you can accept the order.

To accept the order that was confirmed at the POS, perform a PUT sending the `shipment_id` and `access-token` (generated by the OAuth authentication process) to the endpoint[/proximity-integration/shipments/{shipment_id}/accept](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/pt/reference/mp_delivery/_proximity-integration_shipments_shipment_id_accept/put). Check [Security](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/security/oauth/introduction) for more information about OAuth.

When accepting the order, the status will be changed and the new order status will be indicated in the response.

> NOTE
>
> Important
>
> It is important to know that only in the states **ready_to_ship** and **ready_to_print** it is possible to accept an order. After accepting the order, the substatus will be “printed”. If the order is not accepted 5 minutes after its creation, it will be automatically cancelled.
