# Get store data

To get information about all stores that are linked to **a specific user**, perform a GET by sending the `user_id` and `access-token` (generated by the OAuth authentication process) to the [/proximity-integration/users/{seller_id}/stores](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/reference/mp_delivery/_proximity-integration_users_seller_id_stores/get). See [Security](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/security/oauth/introduction) for more information about OAuth.

It is also possible to consult information for a **specific store** using its **ID**. To do this, perform a GET sending the `store_id` and `access-token` to the endpoint [/proximity-integration/stores/{StoreID}](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/reference/mp_delivery/_proximity-integration_stores_store_id/get).

This endpoint point returns all data from the previous endpoint, plus information about the current ("enabled", "paused" or "disabled") store health status. See [Change Store Status](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/developers/en/guides/mp-delivery/print-order-receipt) for more information about statuses.
