# Store management

From the request made through REST APIs, with the identification returned in the `user_id` attribute, you can consult some information about the stores that receive the orders, such as:

* Store ID.
* Location of establishment.
* Opening hours.
* External ID (if any).

With `store_id` you can check and change the store's operating status, in addition to being able to create an external ID that will be used as an identifier for an order management software system.
