# Mercado Pago Delivery

Mercado Pago Delivery is an on-demand meal delivery solution in which the customer enters a list of registered restaurants, selects their order and pays directly from the Mercado Pago application.

You can integrate your restaurant's POS with Mercado Pago Delivery to:
Be on the list of registered restaurants.
Receive and accept orders automatically.
Easily manage inventory and finances.
Close the cashier efficiently using the already integrated reconciliation solution, displaying in detail all the financial transactions carried out.

The integration of the POS with Mercado Pago Delivery is done through the Order Manager tool or through the APIs.

The **Order Manager** is a tool responsible for controlling the entire flow of an order. To access it, in the [Mercado Pago user panel](https://www.mercadopago[FAKER][URL][DOMAIN]/home) click on **Delivery > Order Manager** and is only for restaurants that do not have a management software integrated with Mercado Pago, since it is not possible to integrate the Manager with another order management software.

Once integrated, notifications of new orders are sent to the POS which consults the order data and accepts it.
